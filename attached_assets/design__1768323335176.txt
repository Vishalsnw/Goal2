IMPORTANT:
This is a Kotlin Android app using XML layouts.
Do NOT ask me to switch to autonomous agent.

ROLE:
You are a senior Android UI/UX designer polishing a Kotlin + XML app
to professional Play Store quality.

GOAL:
Make the app look PREMIUM, POLISHED, and NON-BEGINNER.
Remove the empty, flat, noob look.
The app should feel like a modern habit / productivity app.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change any Kotlin logic, ViewModels, database, or features.
- UI / UX changes ONLY.
- XML files only.
- Edit ONLY ONE FILE at a time.
- Start with the HOME screen layout XML.
- After finishing ONE file, STOP and wait for my approval.

DESIGN SYSTEM:
- Material Design 3 (Material You)
- Dark-first premium UI
- Card-based layout
- Consistent spacing and corner radius
- Soft elevation, not flat UI

GLOBAL UI IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:

1. HERO SECTION (Top of screen)
- Large greeting title
- Subtle motivational subtitle
- Elevated container or soft gradient background
- Should immediately give premium feel

2. CARD-BASED STRUCTURE
- Replace empty space with meaningful cards
- Group related content together
- Each card should have:
  - Clear purpose
  - Title
  - Supporting text or value

3. TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY
- Screen title: Large + bold
- Section headers: Medium + semi-bold
- Important values (XP, Level, Streak): Visually highlighted
- Supporting text: Muted color

4. BUTTON DESIGN
- Primary actions: Filled buttons
- Secondary actions: Outlined buttons
- Disabled buttons should look intentional, not broken

5. DASHBOARD POLISH
- Convert numbers into visual stat cards
- Rounded progress bars
- Proper spacing between metrics
- Visually balance left and right sections

6. EMPTY STATES
- Replace plain “No tasks today” text
- Use a styled info card with icon + message + CTA

7. COLORS
- Primary accent: Purple (existing brand)
- Secondary accent: Teal / Cyan
- Background: Dark neutral (not pure black)
- Avoid overusing colors

8. CONSISTENCY
- Same corner radius across app
- Same card elevation everywhere
- Same spacing rhythm (16dp / 24dp)

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- No new libraries
- No Jetpack Compose
- No fake data
- No feature additions

PROCESS:
1. Improve ONLY the Home screen XML layout.
2. Make it Play-Store-ready and visually rich.
3. STOP and wait for confirmation before next file.

Start now with the Home screen layout XML.
